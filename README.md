# TURBO THUNDER SNAIL RACERS

## <a href='https://epic-turbo-thunder-snail-racers.onrender.com/' target='_blank'>Snail Racers</a>

## The Story:

### The race to determine who is the FASTEST, most FURIOUS, most BESTEST snail in all of TWILIGHT GARDEN Dom Tomato stands the champion of all the gardens, but a rising up racer Brian Corn decides to challenge him on in the EPIC TURBO THUNDER SNAIL RACE

## The Rules:
### Player 1 is to spam the 'D' key in order to encourage Dom to reach the finish line.
### Player 2 is to spam the '=>' key in order to encourage Brian to reach the finish line.

### The first snail to reach the finish line will have completed one lap, and the other will lose.
### The rounds are automatic, so once you cross the finish line, you have to keep going.
### The winner will be based out of who has the best out of 3 score.

## Things to note:
### There is no tie, when crosing the finish line, it is determined from the methods which snail crossed first
